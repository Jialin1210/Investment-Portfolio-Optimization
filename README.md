# Investment-Portfolio-Optimization
## Abstract
There are two ways to make money, 
the first is by working for yourself or for someone else and the other 
is to invest your assets so that they grow over time. A baseline that 
many investors use is the S&P 500, which is the collection of 500 large companies 
in the United States. Historically speaking, the S&P 500 has a return of 6-8%, 
which is higher than the risk-free US treasury bill (2% return on average). 
However, some investors are looking to get a higher return than the S&P 500 while 
others are looking to take on less risk than the index. We are choosing the investment 
topic in order to find strategies that satisfy both clients who want some level of returns 
and the minimum amount of risk and clients who want the least amount of risk and the highest 
amount of returns.
